# Shift invariant filtering
* A transformation is shift invariant if and only if shifted impulses produce identical but shifted responses

# [Convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution)
* To perform convolution, the filter singal is flipped and set to negative infinity. We then move the flipped filter signal slowly to positive infinity.
* Properties:
	* commutativity: f*s = s*f
	* associativity: f*(g*s) = (f*g)*s
	* distributivity: f*(g+s) = f*g + f*s
