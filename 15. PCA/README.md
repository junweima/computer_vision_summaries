# [PCA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5ynBdHqnGU)

# steps:
* data preprocessing
* compute covariance matrix
* compute eigenvector of sigma
* apply dimensionality reduction

# choosing K
* choose K so that 99% variance is reserved
* easier way to choose K
	* use singular values to find K

# applications of PCA
* compression
	* storing data
