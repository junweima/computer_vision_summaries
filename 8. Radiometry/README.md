# Radiant intensity I(w)
* w = angle
* unit: W/sr where W = watts, sr = solid angle

# Irradiance H(p)
* p = point of interest
* It is the power coming in
* unit: W/m^2

# Radiance L(p)
* It represents the power coming out
* unit: W/(sr * m^2)

# BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function)
* rho = radiance/irradiance
* unit: /sr

# [Phong reflectance model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model)
* Basically saying that reflectance contains 3 parts
	* Ambient
	* Diffuse (Lambertian)
	* Specular (mirror)
