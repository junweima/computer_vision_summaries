# K means
* pros: easy, guaranteed to converge
* cons: sensitive to initialization such as number of cluters. Also it's looking for spherical clusters if using Gaussian.

# mean-shift algorithm
* basically the idea is to move the center of the model to the center of mass
* pros: automatic
* cons: doesn't work well in high-dimensions
