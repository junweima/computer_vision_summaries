# Lecture video on pyramids

# Goal
* Decompose image into smaller scaled images to extract features

# Gaussian pyramids
* Recursively smoothing the image with smoothing filter w
* REDUCE(): recursively downsampling the image by 2

# Laplacian pyramids
* It's the difference of Gaussian pyramids
* EXPAND(): recursively upsampling the image by 2

# Haar Wavelet transform
* It's computated from taking the average and difference of adjacent pairs
* This is what JPEG does
